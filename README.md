# odin-recipes

A brutal place for a couple of nice recipes.

This project is a place to continue practice using html, css, and the process of version control using git and committing work to github for review or collaboration. It will also serve as a secret trove of recipes that I personally have hand picked from the dungeons of time to be discovered and and used again in the near and distant future.
